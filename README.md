C++ Derivative Calculator
Program reads in a file containing functions containing polynomial and trig (sin, cos, tan) functions. Each line contains one
expression. It will read the file line by line, parsing the read values and putting them into a linkedlist. It will then derive
the expression and output the result to a text file.
